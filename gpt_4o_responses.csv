111974+self:USA+fiction,"I wanted to read a book by David Foster Wallace before eventually attempting 'Infinite Jest'. I had already dabbled in one of his non-novels - I can't remember which - and didn't really get on with it. Then I happened to find the Penguin Ink edition of this in a bookshop, and I'm glad I did, not least because the font is perfect. 
 It made my head hurt a little without making me get fed up of it, or being too clever for its own good, which is pretty impressive. And gosh, it just made a perverse amount of sense. I don't think I can say anything else about it that no-one else has ever said; capturing modern life as it really is was Wallace's talent - at 24! - after all. So I'll just end by saying this is more than indicative of a brilliant mind and I can't wait to read more of his work.",,,,,,,

 It made my head hurt a little without making me get fed up of it, or being too clever for its own good, which is pretty impressive. And gosh, it just made a perverse amount of sense. I don't think I can say anything else about it that no-one else has ever said; capturing modern life as it really is was Wallace's talent - at 24! - after all.
