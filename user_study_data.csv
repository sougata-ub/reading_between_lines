It got me thinking about sentimentality, and by chance I happened to run across this book. I wanted to dig more deeply into Rorty's idea, and I hoped that Dalrymple might develop it further. He definitely does. It's true that Dalrymple is an old-fashioned curmudgeon (as some of the other reviewers have noted). But he does he have an interesting personal history (prison psychiatrist, lived in Africa etc.), and he makes many thought-provoking points despite a somewhat rambling style. The book is short and very readable. 
 Sentimentality is an incredibly powerful force in the world of 2015. It's politically reshaping the world. And yet there is almost no analysis of it (at least within my book and media consumption bubble). On that count alone, this is a valuable book.

I like the way Verghese writes. I loved Cutting for Stone, but this book was not as good, as a whole. This is more of a memoir about an interesting friendship that revolved around tennis. David is a young doctor who has struggled with drug use. He befriends Verghese and they become tennis partners. It is an unlikely friendship, but they are each able to teach each other things. A good story, but the tennis chapters got in the way. I couldn't follow all of the tennis lingo. The chapters about the friendship were really good.

But that summer, the local hospital treated its first AIDS patient, and before long a crisis that had once seemed an ""urban problem"" had arrived in town to stay.

 This is a story of courage and fear, of uninformed reactions and thoughtful response, of death and living, of bemoaning one's fate and rising to the occasion, of being an outsider and belonging to a community, of angry denial and graceful acceptance.

The narrator, Marion, is exceptionally moral and a fairly lifeless character, but then engages in two separate acts of violence that are baffling, troubling, and completely out of character. The misogynistic way that Verghese treats the character of Genet (Marion's love interest) is reprehensible and ultimately made the book unredeemable for me.

The narrator, Marion, is exceptionally moral and a fairly lifeless character, but then engages in two separate acts of violence that are baffling, troubling, and completely out of character. The misogynistic way that Verghese treats the character of Genet (Marion's love interest) is reprehensible and ultimately made the book unredeemable for me.

It got me thinking about sentimentality, and by chance I happened to run across this book. I wanted to dig more deeply into Rorty's idea, and I hoped that Dalrymple might develop it further. He definitely does. It's true that Dalrymple is an old-fashioned curmudgeon (as some of the other reviewers have noted). But he does he have an interesting personal history (prison psychiatrist, lived in Africa etc.), and he makes many thought-provoking points despite a somewhat rambling style. The book is short and very readable. 
 Sentimentality is an incredibly powerful force in the world of 2015. It's politically reshaping the world. And yet there is almost no analysis of it (at least within my book and media consumption bubble). On that count alone, this is a valuable book. It at least flags this important issue.",yes,yes,genre_influence_slight,demographic_influence_moderate,familiar,understood,similar_demo_genre_maybe,,NA

 After the first two books, I had high hopes. The plot was good; it had purpose - ""Evil"" had risen in Meluha, Shiva had to stop it. 
 And then came ""the oath of vayuputras"" . Instead of the story being about Shiva and his ultimate triumph over evil, it became the story about, the balance between ""Good"" and ""Evil"". that had been destroyed(seriously!) and that Shiva must remove ""Evil"" and restore ""Good"".All this was told over in like 50 pages with words good & evil being repeated in every other sentence. 
 Most disappointing about this book was the terrible ending. it took me days to complete this book.

It got me thinking about sentimentality, and by chance I happened to run across this book. I wanted to dig more deeply into Rorty's idea, and I hoped that Dalrymple might develop it further. He definitely does. It's true that Dalrymple is an old-fashioned curmudgeon (as some of the other reviewers have noted). But he does he have an interesting personal history (prison psychiatrist, lived in Africa etc.), and he makes many thought-provoking points despite a somewhat rambling style. The book is short and very readable.
